4.20]  Is there animals?
[328.04 - 329.98]  Don't really know how to draw it.
[330.50 - 338.68]  I'm just sort of in the...
[340.70 - 342.02]  He's into the water.
[342.52 - 343.06]  He'll help.
[343.90 - 345.54]  Sort of give an idea.
[346.32 - 349.20]  I have no idea how one would explain this.
[350.88 - 352.20]  I'm going to get some whiskers.
[353.32 - 355.06]  Basically it's supposed to be a seal.
[356.28 - 358.04]  You can imagine it in the water.
[358.62 - 364.04]  I like them because they're like playful and silly sort of have a good time.
[365.64 - 369.54]  I'm not going to try them for time like it can get any better than that.
[372.26 - 380.40]  Okay, I'm Rose and I'm project manager from California.
[407.56 - 408.26]  See.
[411.06 - 414.52]  It's definitely a little harder once you're doing it.
[415.08 - 416.22]  It's actually a coyote.
[416.82 - 417.08]  Let's see.
[417.78 - 420.08]  Give it a little bit of snout.
[420.54 - 420.86]  I don't know.
[421.04 - 421.36]  Some teeth.
[422.78 - 423.48]  Yeah.
[424.10 - 424.80]  That's pretty impressive.
[426.84 - 427.72]  Oh dear.
[428.86 - 433.06]  I live right across the street from an open space in California.
[433.32 - 435.02]  We have coyotes all the time.
[435.84 - 439.92]  I really enjoy their singing and their beautiful animals.
[442.74 - 443.42]  Okay.
[444.14 - 448.22]  Moving on to slightly more serious stuff.
[449.88 - 451.80]  I'm going to talk about project finances.
[452.72 - 453.64]  We have a couple.
[455.24 - 462.70]  We'd like to sell it for about 25 euro with a profit aim of 50 million euro for all our sales.
[463.32 - 465.36]  And because this is such, this is for television.
[466.06 - 467.46]  We have a market range of internet.
[467.82 - 469.38]  Like it's an international market range.
[469.48 - 470.88]  We don't have to worry about specifics.
[472.64 - 480.30]  In order to make a profit of this magnitude, we need to be able to produce each one at a maximum of 1250 euro.
[480.30 - 485.16]  So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for.
[490.32 - 490.72]  Okay.
[493.28 - 495.80]  Just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project.
[496.58 - 499.62]  I'd like to hear about your experiences using remote controls.
[500.58 - 503.96]  Your first idea is about creating a new remote control.
[504.26 - 508.44]  What would be the best that you, what are the features that you really like?
[508.44 - 510.66]  What are the features that you don't like, etc.
[512.72 - 518.62]  So I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the TV.
[518.74 - 523.82]  Like you have to do one for the power of the TV and then like another one to get the actual screen on and
[523.82 - 525.28]  and nothing else to get it all going.
[525.46 - 525.84]  I don't know.
[526.00 - 529.68]  Now they keep combining all different remote together.
[530.00 - 534.90]  And I don't know if I necessarily like that because I feel like you end up like multi-media overload.
[534.90 - 537.42]  I just want to watch the TV here.
[541.06 - 542.10]  Always gets fast.
[542.76 - 545.84]  I'm sort of like devised to help you find it.
[550.74 - 551.48]  I do.
[551.84 - 557.94]  I do like because TV and the city plan is in the corner.
[559.74 - 563.08]  I guess that we're in the middle of the day.
[563.32 - 566.04]  We then have to get up and move across the street.
[566.92 - 569.38]  Especially if you're someone really lazy like me.
[572.52 - 577.58]  I find that they can be annoying especially my modules TV.
[577.84 - 579.50]  I have a lot of things happening.
[579.72 - 584.82]  I can go to one for the TV, one for the digital box, one for the digital.
[587.62 - 590.70]  And also my dad is a sensitive user.
[591.02 - 593.02]  There are too many buttons on them.
[594.44 - 596.16]  It's just complicated.
[597.26 - 599.40]  All I really want to do is switch on and off.
[599.62 - 600.64]  Change the channel, change the volume.
[603.18 - 603.62]  Yeah.
[605.46 - 608.76]  I agree with having too many remote surround.
[608.94 - 612.88]  My dad has a whole drawer at home of remote sort of various things.
[612.88 - 614.44]  I don't know how to work half of them.
[617.28 - 620.88]  What's important for me, I guess, is that it's easy to use.
[623.06 - 624.24]  There's not too many buttons.
[624.38 - 625.42]  They're not too small.
[626.78 - 628.52]  I need to know what you're doing.
[630.52 - 637.46]  One thing I particularly like is if you're not moving it around to get it to work with the infrared.
[637.46 - 640.24]  I think there's a way around that.
[640.96 - 647.20]  But I know in my residence right now that the television you have to walk all around the room to turn on.
[647.50 - 651.14]  It's just simpler to just turn around the TV itself.
[651.34 - 655.66]  If you're going to make a remote control, it should actually work for what it's doing.
[657.54 - 659.70]  There's about batteries and things like that.
[659.98 - 665.98]  Are there some remote that don't require batteries or do well remote require batteries?
[667.00 - 668.12]  I would imagine all of them.
[668.22 - 671.26]  But it's also we could use a lithium battery.
[672.10 - 674.40]  That would last a lot longer than like double A's.
[675.58 - 679.18]  Those are the batteries that are used in a lot of MP3 players now.
[679.42 - 679.84]  That kind of thing.
[687.76 - 694.14]  It seems we have a little bit of a conflict over combining all the remote together
[694.14 - 696.90]  versus having five different remote.
[698.92 - 704.86]  You said you don't like having all the buttons on one remote and yet you don't want to have five remote.
[705.82 - 706.62]  How do we work with that?
[707.46 - 711.14]  Could we get something that just has...
[711.86 - 717.10]  It doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or programs,
[717.10 - 720.38]  other things that I'm not very coherent about.
[721.10 - 725.60]  But that just has your major buttons for that work for everything.
[725.88 - 730.32]  Volume control on off, channel changing.
[730.74 - 732.50]  Maybe that spatially divides it.
[732.68 - 736.54]  If you're trying to get the TV on, that's the top thing on the remote.
[736.92 - 740.62]  I don't know if it would be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're going to make it.
[740.84 - 744.00]  But if it's all the TV surface here, then all the DCR surface here,
[744.00 - 748.12]  or whatever else we have programmed into it, it's all just in its separate place.
[748.30 - 751.48]  And all the on buttons together, because then you're like, I don't even know what I'm turning on.
[753.58 - 757.78]  If you'd save the more complicated functions, maybe for separate remotes,
[758.48 - 760.16]  that you wouldn't need to use every day.
[761.18 - 765.96]  So maybe you have one remote that has the main functions on off, channel changing volume,
[766.28 - 768.28]  and another remote with all the special things.
[768.28 - 773.88]  Because that is one thing that remotes tend to have buttons that the TVs no longer have as well.
[774.48 - 778.22]  So you have to have them somewhere, because you're going to need those special functions occasionally.
[780.22 - 783.18]  But not necessarily on the normal level.
[783.82 - 787.52]  Can I ask you, is there any remote control for television?
[788.96 - 790.00]  Good question.
[790.00 - 793.78]  And if this device is just to be used for the television,
[794.62 - 799.06]  would we even technically be possible to get the remote control from the TV?
[800.88 - 802.28]  I don't know that yet.
[802.58 - 807.98]  Just to get television, television, and letting you find it.
[809.96 - 811.04]  That's a good question.
[813.70 - 814.88]  I'll look into it.
[815.90 - 817.32]  I think it's just TV.
[817.68 - 821.12]  I mean, if we're taking it, just what it's said.
[821.94 - 824.08]  New product, a new television or remote control.
[824.74 - 830.62]  It's not like, you know, I think it might be more advanced than that.
[832.68 - 837.52]  So we should, we should be seeing that it's just the television that they want to be.
[839.58 - 844.80]  Well, I suppose it would be nice to have the radio and recording stuff that we want to keep the TV in the TV.
[845.00 - 848.16]  But I don't know, I'm like, setting it up to be a little bit more advanced.
[850.26 - 853.58]  So I guess we had to define what we're aiming for.
[854.22 - 856.96]  If it's just a television, then that's a bit simpler,
[857.14 - 859.92]  because there's less buttons that would even need to be on it.
[860.42 - 860.58]  Yeah.
[861.34 - 864.66]  It's going to be a good idea that the buttons being driven by the wall and large.
[864.66 - 868.74]  If you have older people or people like me that aren't very coordinated hand-eye,
[868.98 - 871.50]  it's really quite important that you're not pressing a small,
[871.74 - 875.68]  a teeny mobile phone size buttons if we can help it.
[878.24 - 878.72]  Okay.
[879.70 - 882.46]  Sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas.
[882.80 - 883.52]  Might if we move on.
[884.80 - 885.28]  Okay.
[887.34 - 890.18]  Now our next meeting starts in 30 minutes.
[890.18 - 894.86]  I believe we've actually been only working on this one for about 20.
[895.38 - 897.64]  So we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like.
[899.44 - 902.82]  But this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually.
[903.38 - 905.36]  The Industrial Design, Alima.
[905.62 - 907.62]  We'll be doing the working design.
[910.18 - 912.10]  User interface designer, that's for you.
[912.28 - 915.66]  So technical functions, I guess, like keeping in mind the buttons,
[915.66 - 919.00]  things, the size of the buttons, user requirements.
[920.66 - 925.04]  So you'll be hearing about different trends, about different things that people need.
[925.92 - 930.40]  I guess kind of the same discussion that we've been having we'll get from actual consumers.
[932.88 - 933.26]  Okay.
[935.42 - 938.66]  And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach.
[938.66 - 940.84]  I realized in this past when we didn't have much,
[940.84 - 943.02]  we just wanted to get a little brainstorming done.
[946.06 - 952.58]  So very excited to see all your animals and how wonderful artists we all are.
[958.02 - 959.10]  Any questions?
[975.70 - 977.30]  I haven't gotten an agenda yet.
[977.66 - 978.60]  I'll put that together.
[979.10 - 981.00]  I'm sure as we'll each get our own instructions.
[982.10 - 985.40]  Because what we're going to do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together.
[986.26 - 991.80]  Sure, we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time.
[992.14 - 993.30]  I'm sure we'll be busy.
[996.26 - 996.74]  Okay.
[998.42 - 1002.08]  I'll type up the minutes and probably email those out to all of you,
[1002.78 - 1006.00]  including all the things that we talked about.
[1008.92 - 1011.00]  Yes, I think I can.
[1011.66 - 1013.14]  I'll just attach it to an email.
[1013.66 - 1017.88]  And your number two, I'm two, three, four, is that correct?
[1018.06 - 1020.32]  All right.
[1021.40 - 1022.54]  It's lovely meeting you all.
[1032.02 - 1034.76]  Just make sure to keep checking the company website and the emails.
[1039.56 - 1041.20]  I think we'll see if I can do that right now.
