Annotations and Transcripts

The AMI corpus also provides:

Manual transcripts for accurate evaluation

Speaker segmentation and labels

Dialogue act and topic annotations

Meeting summaries and action items (for selected meetings)

These annotations allow both quantitative evaluation (e.g., transcription accuracy) and qualitative analysis (e.g., discussion flow).
