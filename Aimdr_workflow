NLP (summary, action items)

`Whisper:

Voice to text is implemented using OpenAI Whisper, a transformer-based automatic speech recognition model. The system records meeting audio through a microphone, converts it into WAV format, and processes it using Whisper to generate accurate text transcripts even in noisy environments. This transcript is later used for summarization and action-item extraction.”
