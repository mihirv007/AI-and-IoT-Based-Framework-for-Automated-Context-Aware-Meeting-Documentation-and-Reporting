# How to Write a Research Paper for Your AMI-Based Project

Think of your paper as answering **one core question**:

> *“How effectively can a multi-modal AI system analyze real meeting recordings for transcription, speaker identification, and structured reporting?”*

---

## 1️⃣ Decide the Paper Focus (VERY IMPORTANT)

Don’t try to write *everything*. Pick **one clear contribution**.

### Best paper angles for YOUR project

(choose 1 main, 1 secondary):

✅ **Primary**

* Automated Meeting Transcription & Speaker Identification
* Context-aware Meeting Understanding using ASR + NLP

✅ **Secondary**

* IoT + RFID based participant identification
* End-to-end meeting analytics web system

📌 **Recommended title focus**:

> *“An AI-Based System for Automated Meeting Transcription and Speaker-Aware Summarization using the AMI Corpus”*

---

## 2️⃣ Standard Research Paper Structure (IEEE / Springer)

### 🧩 1. Abstract (150–250 words)

**What to include:**

* Problem
* Dataset (AMI)
* Methods (ASR, Speaker ID, NLP)
* Results (WER, diarization accuracy)
* Contribution

**Example (short):**

> This paper presents an automated meeting analysis system integrating speech recognition, speaker identification, and natural language processing. Using scenario meetings from the AMI corpus (ES2008a), the system transcribes multi-speaker discussions, identifies participants, and generates structured meeting summaries. Experimental evaluation demonstrates effective transcription accuracy and speaker-aware content extraction, enabling practical deployment in real-world meeting environments.
